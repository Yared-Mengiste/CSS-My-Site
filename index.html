          <h3>Design and Develope</h3>
          <p>
            I possess a versatile skill set in designing and developing
            products, leveraging my expertise in various programming languages.
            Proficient in C#, Java, C++, and Python, I am adept at crafting
            robust and efficient solutions for diverse applications. My
            proficiency extends to web development, where I excel in creating
            dynamic and user-friendly websites. I have a keen understanding of
            SQL Server, enabling me to design and implement robust database
            solutions for seamless data management. With a solid foundation in
            both front-end and back-end development, I bring a comprehensive
            approach to product design, ensuring a harmonious integration of
            technologies to deliver high-quality and scalable solutions. My
            commitment to staying abreast of industry trends and adopting best
            practices allows me to contribute effectively to the entire product
            development lifecycle.

          <h3>Draw</h3>
          <p>
            I possess an intermediate skill level in drawing, a passion I
            cultivated as a hobby. Over the years, I have dedicated time to
            honing my artistic abilities, allowing me to express creativity and
            bring ideas to life through the strokes of a pencil or pen. Although
            I may not be a professional artist, my commitment to learning and
            practicing the art of drawing has granted me a satisfying level of
            proficiency. This hobby has not only served as a source of personal
            enjoyment but has also provided me with a unique outlet for
            self-expression and a means to explore my creative instincts. As I
            continue to nurture my drawing skills, I find joy in the process of
            improvement and the ability to translate imagination into tangible
            visual representations.
